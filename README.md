This is a preview of a new not-for-profit software company designed to accelerate academic publishing, starting with Computer Science and Natural Language Processing research.

[Jump to FAQ](#faq)

This not-for-profit tackles problems with academic software that authors and research groups struggle to address on their own, even with sufficient training. For example:

+ [Reproducibility](#reproducibility)
+ [Sustainable design](#sustainable-design)
+ [Community building](#community-building)
+ [Sponsorship](#sponsorship)

### Reproducibility

Months can be spent rewriting code that already exists in order to *reproduce a result* in a paper, often because the code used to develop the paper was never shared but sometimes because the code is available and is too hard to understand, build, or execute. Less discussed, another need is to be able to *reproduce states* of a model or algorithm during paper development, for example to retrain a model from an earlier point in time, to test a single step of an algorithm in isolation, or to better keep track of intermediate results.

> **Solutions:** We're excited to be working with the [ACM’s Artifact Review and Badging committee](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging) to develop open source tools that help authors quickly containerize diverse software artifacts so they can submit more artifacts and earn badges.
>
> We’re also reaching out to machine learning authors to learn about how we can store the history of their model changes and training steps to help them accelerate their current projects. If you’ve published papers or reports in machine learning, [you can help](#reach-out).

### Sustainable design

Creating a modular and experiment-friendly open source project can take weeks to months of documentation and development work, time that most graduate students and faculty don’t have. Further, projects developed by industry are often “one size fits all”, meaning that they aren’t designed to give students and faculty the visibility or the flexibility they need. In the worst case, valuable academic software projects do exist but research groups end up abandoning them when original authors leave and no one in the group has the time to learn how to maintain them.

> **Solutions:** We’re currently working with a research group in Chicago on open sourcing a mature Natural Language Processing project in a sustainable way. That means transforming an experimental code base into modular, reusable steps that can be written in any modern programming language. We’ll publish an in-depth case study covering the benefits of the new design soon.

### Community building

Even if attracting new users can lead to more citations, rarely do authors have the time or the resources to help new users with their projects after publication. A small user base also means that there are limited opportunities to find outside contributors and sponsors to keep valuable projects going after original authors move on to other projects.

> **Solutions:** The authors of a popular research database need a sustainable home for their project, which hasn’t been updated in several years. We're offering to host the database, keep it updated, create a modern promotional website, and maintain documentation that attracts new users in both academia and industry. More details to come in Spring 2019 as this project progresses.

### Sponsorship

Valuable projects with broad reach, for example projects used by many similar research groups or projects used by both academia and industry, can become highly sustainable by finding sponsors willing to contribute intellectual, financial, and technical resources in exchange for being able to use the projects to gain new technical talent, users, or investment opportunities. Unfortunately, the average author doesn’t have the networks or the time to pitch to these potential sponsors. And without mediation, some sponsors may try to transform projects into something that primarily serves *their* needs, ignoring and effectively cutting off the original research communities.

> **Solutions:** With a base in Silicon Valley, we’re able to work with government representatives, large technology companies, and venture capitalists that have strong incentives to invest in new Computer Science and Natural Language Processing research. As a not-for-profit and a neutral intermediary, we hope to encourage sponsors to invest in a broad range of projects.

#### Who’s behind this?

Hi, I’m [Erin Dahlgren](https://edahlgren.com/), the initiator of the not-for-profit. I have a background in Linguistics research (University of Chicago), startups (Y Combinator), and security research for virtualization at scale (Google). I’ll be managing communications, finding sponsors, and leading development of our initial projects.

A special thanks to our initial collaborators: the [ACM’s Artifact Review and Badging committee](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging) and [graduate students](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/students/) and [faculty](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/) from the University of Chicago.

#### What does it cost?

Nothing for academic researchers. We may decide to charge outsiders (e.g. industry) for tools we develop as a way to raise revenue to support more projects in need of our help.

#### What’s the name of this not-for-profit?

We have yet to settle on a name. We’re considering using the name of a bright color (e.g. “tangerine”), but we would love to hear your suggestions because naming is hard!

#### Where’s your website?

We’re still working on our website. If you’d like to help, send us links to well-designed informational websites and tell us why you like them.

#### How are you different from organizations like The Software Sustainability Institute?

[The Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) is a fantastic organization that provides software training to academic researchers (sometimes in partnership with [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)), awards stipends through a [fellowship program](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme) to encourage workshops and training, and offers many other benefits not limited to [educational materials](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides) and [software consulting](https://www.software.ac.uk/who-do-we-work).

The not-for-profit described here takes a different, complimentary approach. Similar to [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and [the Apache Foundation](https://www.apache.org/), it takes specific software and database projects under its wing and incubates them under an umbrella. It is not capable of providing the level of training that [the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) or [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) can provide, but it can lead in the development, investment, and promotion of valuable projects that don’t have enough time or resources to get to the next level.

We hope to work with [the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) as an employer of [research software engineers](https://www.software.ac.uk/research-software-engineers). We share their belief that research software engineers are fundamental in a world where most research is powered by software.

#### How do you operate?

At the moment, we operate as a not-for-profit software development and consulting practice, free for academics in exchange for projects coming under our umbrella, similar to how [the Linux Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) and [the Apache Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) operate.

In general, the projects we work on have open source code. This gives academic researchers the visibility they need to explain and conduct experiments. With the permission of authors, we may explore adding closed-sourced features to projects that we would still offer to academics for free but we would sell to outsiders as a way to raise revenue to support more projects in need of our help.

#### Are you hiring?

Not at the moment, but only because we are still in the early stages of raising revenue to support more full-time employees. If you are interested in working as a research software engineer on open source infrastructure for Computer Science and Natural Language Processing research, send us a message anyway.

#### Can I ask you for help with my project?

Definitely! We’d love to hear about what you’re doing to see if and how we can help. It’s possible that we can better justify investing in an area if we hear about similar projects or problems from multiple people.
