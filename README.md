# Accelerating publishing

*Audience: members of the ACM*

[FAQ](#faq)

This is a preview of a not-for-profit software development company designed to accelerate the publishing of academic papers. Initially its focus is on addressing problems with academic software in Computer Science and Natural Language Processing. For example,

### Reproducibility

Months can be wasted writing code (potentially incorrectly) to reproduce results in papers, either because the code used to develop a paper was never shared or because code is available but is too hard to understand, build, or use. Also related to reproducibility, a common need is being able to reproduce states of a model or algorithm during the paper development process, for example to retrain a model from an earlier state, to test a single step of an algorithm in isolation, or to better keep track of intermediate results.

> **Solutions:** We’ll be working with the ACM’s Artifact Review and Badging committee to develop tools that help authors quickly containerize diverse software artifacts and earn badges. We’re also reaching out to machine learning authors to learn how we can store the history of their model changes and training steps, to help them accelerate their current projects. If you’ve published papers or reports on machine learning topics, you can help (link to get involved).

### Sustainable software design

Creating a modular and experiment-friendly open source software project can take weeks to months of documentation and development work, time that most graduate students and faculty don’t have. Worse, projects developed by industry are often “one size fits all”, meaning that they aren’t designed to give graduate students and faculty members the visibility and flexibility they need. In the worst case, valuable academic software projects do exist but research groups end up abandoning them when original authors leave and no one in the group has the time to learn how to maintain them.

> **Solutions:** We’re currently working with a research group in Chicago on open sourcing a Natural Language Processing project in a sustainable way. That means transforming an experimental code base into modular, reusable steps that can be written in any modern programming language. We’ll cover all of the benefits of the new design in a case study soon.

### Community building

Even if attracting new academic users leads to more citations, rarely do authors have the time or the resources to help new users with their projects after publication. A small user base also means that there are limited opportunities to find outside contributors and sponsors to keep valuable projects going after original authors move on to other projects.

> **Solutions:** The authors of a popular research database need a sustainable host for their project, which hasn’t been updated in several years. We can host the database, keep it updated, provide a modern promotional website, and and maintain documentation that attracts new users in academia and industry. More details to come in Spring 2019.

### Sponsorship.

Valuable projects with broad reach, for example projects used by many similar research groups or projects used by both academia and industry, can become highly sustainable by finding sponsors willing to contribute intellectual, financial, and technical resources in exchange for being able to use the projects to attract new technical talent, users, or investment opportunities. Unfortunately, authors don’t have the networks or the time to pitch to many of these sponsors. And without mediation, some sponsors may try to transform projects into something that serves their own needs or profits, ignoring or even cutting off the original research communities.

> **Solutions:** With a base in Silicon Valley, we’re constantly reaching out to government representatives, large technology companies, and venture capitalists that have incentives to invest in new Computer Science and Natural Language Processing research. We’re also exploring ways to offer tools to academic researchers for free while charging outsiders as a way to raise revenue ourselves. As an not-for-profit intermediary, we hope to encourage investment in a very broad range of projects.

#### Who’s behind this?

Hi, I’m Erin Dahlgren, the initiator of this not-for-profit. I have a background in Linguistics research (University of Chicago), startups (YCombinator), and security research for virtualization at scale (Google). I’ll be the one to find initial sponsors, manage logistics, and develop our initial projects. With more success stories under our belt, joining me will be research software engineers (a role in between academia and industry) from around the country.

Thanks to our initial collaborators: the ACM’s Artifact Review and Badging committee and graduate students and faculty from the University of Chicago.

#### What’s the name of this not-for-profit?

We have yet to settle on a name. We’re considering names of bright colors (e.g. “tangerine”), but we would love to hear your suggestions because naming is hard! Send us a quick note:

> *email:* edahlgren@uchicago.edu
> *subject:* “AccPub name: (your suggestion)”
> *body:* (can be blank)

#### Where’s your website?

We’re still working on our website, mainly because we’re spending most of our time developing our initial projects and building credibility. If you’d like to help, send us links to well-designed informational websites and optionally tell us why you like them:

> *email:* edahlgren@uchicago.edu
> *subject:* “AccPub websites”
> *body:* Links to websites

#### How are you different from organizations like The Software Sustainability Institute?

The Software Sustainability Institute is a fantastic organization that provides software training to academic researchers (sometimes in partnership with The Carpentries), awards stipends through a fellowship program to encourage workshops and training, and offers many other benefits not limited to educational materials and software consulting.

The not-for-profit described here takes a different, complimentary approach. It takes specific software and database projects under its wing and incubates them under an umbrella, similar to the Linux Foundation and the Apache Foundation. It is not capable of providing the level of training that the Software Sustainability Institute can provide, but it can lead in the development, investment, and promotion of valuable projects that don’t have enough resources to get to the next level.

We hope to work with the Software Sustainability Institute as an employer of research software engineers. We share the belief that research software engineers are fundamental in a world where most research is powered by software.

#### How do you operate?

At the moment, we operate as a not-for-profit software development and consulting practice, free for academics in exchange for projects coming under our umbrella, similar to how the Linux Foundation and the Apache Foundation operate.

In general, the projects we work on are open sourced. This gives academic researchers the visibility they need to explain and run experiments. With the permission of authors, we may explore adding closed-sourced features to projects that we would offer to academics for free and sell to outsiders as a way to raise revenue to support our open source projects.

#### Are you hiring?

Not at the moment, but only because we’re still in the process of raising enough funding to support full time research software engineers. If you are interested in working as a research software engineer on open source research infrastructure in Computer Science and Natural Language Process, send us a message anyway:

> *email:* edahlgren@uchicago.edu
> *subject:* “AccPub hiring”
> *body:* Tell us why you’re interested and what you research

#### Can I ask you for help with my project?

Definitely! We’d love to hear about what you’re doing to see how we can help. It’s possible that we can better justify investing in an area if we hear about similar projects or problems from multiple groups. Send us a note:

> *email:* edahlgren@uchicago.edu
> *subject:* “AccPub help”
> *body:* Tells about your research domain, your project, and your timeline
